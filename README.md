## Data Warehouse Modeling
This repo is where I will model and upload data to my Snowflake Data Warehouse with DBT.

## But Why
I find it fun :). I also use this as an opportunity to keep learning and growing my understanding of Data Warehouses and working with the various tools used to interact with them.

## Tool Choice
For all of the Data Warehousing, I will be using Snowflake since this is the tool that I have the most practice and exposure to. For the conceptual modeling I will be using <a href="https://dbdiagram.io/home">DB Diagram</a> since it's pretty straightforward to use. For the actual modeling, I will be using DBT, mainly DBT cloud, since I've already used it before and the engineers at my current job also use it.

## Structure
For each repo entry, I will create a new folder with a README file of the DB Diagram model with an explanation and the DBT code.
