## Data Warehouse Modeling
This repo is where I be modeling data and uploading them to my Snowflake Data Warehouse with DBT.

## But Why
I just find it fun :). I also use this as an opportunity to keep learning and growing my understanding of Data Warehouses and working with the various tools that are used to interact with them.

## Tool Choice
For all of the Data Warehousing I will be using Snowflake since this is the tool that I have the most practice and exposure to. For the conceptual modeling I will be using <a href="https://dbdiagram.io/home">DB Diagram</a> since it's pretty straight forward to use. For the actual modeling I will be using DBT, mainly DBT core, since I've already used it before and the engineers at my current job also use it.

## Structure
For each repo entry I will create a new folder with a README file of the DB Diagram model with an explaination and the DBT code.
