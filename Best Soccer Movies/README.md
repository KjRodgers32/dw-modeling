## Why This Data Set?
I have been an on-and-off soccer fan ever since I first started playing FIFA in 2012. The main sport I've played all my life has been football, so watching and playing soccer was a nice and surprising change of pace. I'm still kicking myself for falling asleep during the last World Cup Final with France and Argentina and missing that crazy finish! So when I saw this dataset, I knew this had to be the first one that I modeled.
