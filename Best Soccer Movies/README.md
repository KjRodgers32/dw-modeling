## Why This Data Set?
I have been an on and off soccer fan ever I first started playing FIFA in 2012. The main sport I've played all my life has been football, so watching and playing soccer was a nice and surprising change of pace. I'm still kicking myself for falling asleep during the last World Cup Final with France and Argentina and missing that crazy finish! So when I saw this dataset, I know this had to be first one that I model.

## Questions I'm Looking To Answer With This Data Warehouse
Some of the questions that I'm looking to answer with this dataset are listed below:
- What is the highest rated movie?
- Which year has the highest average rating?
- What movies has the most critic/user reviews?
